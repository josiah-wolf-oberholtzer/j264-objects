CODING STANDARDS

- All objects aligned to 5x5 grid

- Avoid patchlines crossing over objects

- Always use segmented patchcords

- Create helpfiles for every objects demonstrating their functionality
  (when practical)

- Name objects according to their function
  (balancing readability with repeatability)

- Avoid acronyms (except commonly understood ones like "UI")

- All objects must use the default Max5 font face and size (12pt Arial regular)

- D.R.Y. as much as possible - if a subpatcher is used more than once in a single patch,
  it should be an abstraction.
